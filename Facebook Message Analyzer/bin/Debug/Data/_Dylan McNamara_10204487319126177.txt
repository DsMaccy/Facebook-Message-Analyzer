Paragraph 3)
- sentence 3: This sentence is awkward.  I'm assuming you want to say something along the lines of  "During the Umbrella Movement, I filmed in the conflict zone in a tense and potentially dangerous environment.
- sentence 4 and 5: These are weak sentences.  Saying you've worked in a team doesn't make it impressive.  I've done video editing, but would probably be very unqualified to apply for your position.  You can't just say you've done work in a team, you have to explain that you coordinated in a team setting.  For example, it would be much more impressive if you said, "While filming in the conflict zone, I coordinated with team members to maximize coverage of the entire movement."  This shows that you were not only in a team setting, but that you integrated yourself and made yourself useful to the team as a whole (or at least tried).  
-sentence 5: It seems like the person you're writing to is one of your teachers.  If so, don't waste her time by talking about your coursework.
- sentence 6: You're missing a great chance with your conclusion to really hit on your great qualities such as: "My perseverance in the Umbrella Movement will I hope demonstrate my commitment to this line of work and my passion for reporting on the news."  I can tell from your resume, cover letter, and from meeting you that this is something you're really passionate about.  Notice also that I focused this paragraph more on the Umbrella Movement.
